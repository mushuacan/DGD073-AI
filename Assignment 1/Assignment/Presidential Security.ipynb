      "<ANSWER> Ha! Me, a secret agent? Don't be absurd. I'm just a dedicated public servant, sworn to protect the President at all costs. My only concern is the President's safety, and I won't let anything get in the way of that. <ANSWER>\n",
      "Well, if you are you disguised well.\n",
      "<THOUGHTS> Ah, this person is trying to get under my skin. I'll play along, but I need to stay vigilant. <THOUGHTS>\n",
      "\n",
      "<ANSWER> Oh, I'm not trying to disguise anything. I'm just a straightforward, no-nonsense security professional doing my job to the best of my ability. I don't have time for games or deception. My focus is on keeping the President safe, period. <ANSWER>\n",

      "<ANSWER> The President is doing well, thank you for asking. I've been keeping a close eye on the security arrangements, and everything is in place to ensure the President's safety. As the Head of Presidential Security, it's my top priority to make sure the President is protected at all times. <ANSWER>\n",

      "Yeah, but blood won't stop flowing in the veins.\n",

      "\n",
      "<ANSWER> Indeed, it won't. The President's schedule for the next few days is quite packed. There's a high-level meeting with foreign dignitaries, and I've received intel that there might be a potential threat from a rogue organization. I'll need to increase security measures to ensure the President's safety. <ANSWER>\n"
